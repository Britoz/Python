2 Mining:
    1 Sequence Mining
        in time-ordered data, find events that typically precede or follow each other
    2 Text Mining
        in unstructured text data, find words and phrases that define voices and distinguish texts



2 very general approaches to this data mining
    1. Classical Statistics
        Methods based on familiar statistics, typically transparent, possible to calculate by hand
    2. Machine Learning
        More complex methods, often opaque, require substanial computing power
    3. (uncommon) Apriori Algorithm
        For association analysis or 'market basket' analysis
    4. (uncommon) Word Counts
        Using word stems, handling stop words, and comparing frequencies


2 General categories
    1. Text Interfaces
        Programming languages that use written commands; easy to share and repeat
    2. Graphical Interfaces
        Specialized applications that use menus, widgets, and virtual connections; easy-to-see process

Reason for data reduction
    1. Reduce Noise
        Reduce distractions and meaningless information
    2. Focus on Patterns
        Make regularities easier to see by 'Zooming out'
    3. Easier to interpret
        Is easier to interpret and use larger patterns

Algorithms for Data Reductions
    1. Linear Methods
        Straight lines through data; use linear equations
            . Principal component analysis (PCA)
            . Reduce number of variables
            . Maximize variability in lower-dimensional space
    2. Nonlinear Methods
        For high-dimensional manifolds, use complex equations

Couple of considerations about principal component analysis are:
    1. Rotation:
        Multiple components, rotated solutions, can be easier to interpret
    2. Factor Analysis:
        Factors are closely related but based on a different theory
    3. Interpretability:
        For human use, the ability to interpret is critical; less so far machine learning.
