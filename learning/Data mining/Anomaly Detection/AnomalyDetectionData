Univariate outliers
- Variance/SD (Standard Deviation - based measure)
    . Cases are several standard deviations away; Problematic.
- Quartiles
    . Distances are based on the interquartile range(IQR); most common.
- Experience
    . Common standards are used for unusual scores; personal experience.
Box plot anatomy
Bivariate outliers
- Distance Measures
    . Many choices, but usually ignore 2D visualization
- Bivariate Normal Distribution
    . Ellipses over scatterplots
- Density plots

Multivariate outliers
1. Distance Measures
    . Euclidean distance from center of dataset
    . Mahalanobis distance
    . Robust measures of distance
2. Density Measures
    . Local density of data in multidimensional space
    . More flexible are robust
    . Harder to describe
 
Algorithms for Anomaly Detection
. Visual or numerical analysis
. Means-based or robust methods
. Sensitivity vs. interpretability
